# Blind 

![](git-assets/images/blind-logo.png)

Blind is an early state 2D Game Engine for creating interactive application and 2D Rendering implementation.
The Engine uses [**C++ 17**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17) in its core, but the plan is to implement [**C#**](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Sharp)
Scripting for working with the engine. [**OpenGL**](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL) is the currently used Rendering-API and  [**Premake 5**](https://premake.github.io/)
is used for linking and project setup.
